# lax

Lax is a scripting language meant to be a general-purpose, tolerant and
permissive, while remaining simple and efficient.

For this purpose, one key feature of Lax is gradual typing. This allows the use
of both static and dynamic typing ; whether you want a robust and
type-consistent application, or a flexible code base is up to you.

In the long run, Lax aims to support object-oriented & functional paradigms.

This repository contains the implementation of an interpreter for Lax.

As this project is still under development, please move to branch `dev` to see
the current development status.
